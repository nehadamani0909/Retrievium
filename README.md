# Retrievium – Production RAG Platform

## Overview

Retrievium is a production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform engineered for secure document ingestion, semantic retrieval, and AI-powered question answering.

The platform enables users to upload PDF documents, automatically extract and chunk content, generate vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers, and perform hybrid retrieval combining semantic similarity search with lexical relevance scoring. Retrieved context is then supplied to a Groq-hosted Large Language Model to generate grounded, context-aware responses.

Unlike traditional RAG demos, Retrievium implements JWT-based authentication and per-user document ownership enforcement, ensuring that users can only retrieve information from documents they have personally uploaded.

## Technical Highlights

### Hybrid Retrieval

Retrievium combines dense vector retrieval with lexical relevance matching to improve retrieval quality beyond traditional vector-only search systems.

### Ownership-Aware Search

Each document chunk is associated with a specific user identifier.

```sql
WHERE owner_id = current_user_id
```

This guarantees strict user-level document isolation and prevents cross-user data exposure.

### Semantic Search Infrastructure

Embeddings are generated locally with Sentence Transformers and stored inside PostgreSQL using pgvector. Similarity search is executed directly within the database using vector distance operators for efficient semantic retrieval.

### Groq Response Generation

Retrieved chunks are sent to Groq for streamed grounded answers. The default model is configured in `backend/app/services/generation_service.py` as `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and can be changed with `GROQ_MODEL`.

### Upload Error Handling

The upload API validates PDF uploads before indexing. It rejects non-PDF files, empty PDFs, and PDFs with no extractable text, and returns clear error messages to the frontend. Database and processing failures are rolled back and reported with explicit upload/indexing errors.

## Run Locally

### Backend

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/app/.env` and configure:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Example Workflow

1. User creates an account
2. User logs in via JWT authentication
3. PDF documents are uploaded and validated
4. Text is extracted and chunked
5. Sentence Transformer embeddings are generated
6. Chunks are stored in PostgreSQL + pgvector
7. User submits a natural language query
8. Hybrid retrieval identifies relevant context
9. Retrieved context is supplied to Groq
10. A grounded response is streamed back to the user
